# python-devcontainer-template
An example repo for using a Devcontainer + Python üê≥üêç.

[Devcontainers](https://containers.dev/) help us:

- üîÑ Get a reproducible development environment
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Instantly onboard new team members onto your project
- üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Better align the environments between team members
- ‚è± Keeping your dev environment up-to-date & reproducible saves your team time going into production later

(üìù Note: Devcontainers are a relatively new concept. For now, Devcontainers are only properly supported by **VSCode**.)

## This template
This template demonstrates how you can build a Devcontainer with the following set up:

- Python 3.10
- Java (OpenJDK 11.0.16)
- `pyspark`, `mypy`, `pytest` and `black`

## Usage

> First, make sure you have the [Remote Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) installed and have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) running.

Then, there's 2 options:

### Using the template

1. Click _Use this template_ to create a new repo.

    <a href="https://github.com/godatadriven/python-devcontainer-template/generate"><img alt="use this template GitHub button" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/523d7e81c3d3dcd01b711f14c87e850edeb8e62bf72814d3231ab084a0c70d31/68747470733a2f2f7777772e726f737472756d2e626c6f672f706f73742f323031392d30362d31312d612d7265706f2d74656d706c6174652d666f722d722d616e616c797369735f66696c65732f7573652d746869732e706e67" width="150px" /></a>

1. **Clone** the repo and open it in **VSCode**.

1. You should see the following notification:

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godatadriven/python-devcontainer-template/blogpost/images/folder-contains-a-dev-container-config-file.png" alt="folder contains a dev container config file" width="500px"/>

    Press _Reopen in Container_ and you the Devcontainer will be loaded.


That's it üôåüèª Enjoy developing.
